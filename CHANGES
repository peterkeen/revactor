0.1.3:

* Fixed bug where subclasses of Actor still create Actors when spawned

* Implement initial HttpClient on top of Rev::HttpClient

* Omit pointless syntactic sugar in the scheduler loop for a 2.5% performance
  boost.  loop { ... } bad, while true good.

* Fix bug with the toplevel Actor never resuming if a newly spawend Actor
  registeres interest in Rev events.  Toplevel Actor is now rescheduled if
  the event loop isn't running.

0.1.2:

* Change Revactor::TCP::Socket#active to #active? (same for Listener)

* Fix problems with Actor#inspect reporting the wrong object ID

* Initial linking implementation

* Fix problems with zero-length timers

0.1.1:

* Eliminate Actor::Scheduler singleton and replace with thread-specific
  scheduler objects.

* Eliminate Actor.start: now there's a current Actor by default in every thread.
  This paves the way towards thread safety.

* Rename Revactor::Server to Revactor::Delegator and make more like delegator.rb

* Factor apart actor.rb into scheduler.rb and mailbox.rb

* Provide Revactor modules classes within the Actor namespace unless they have
  already been defined

* Fix Revactor::Filter initialization bug

* Include Revactor::VERSION variable

* Mailbox filters can now include only a timeout (i.e. sleep).  Added an
  Actor.sleep shortcut to this behavior.

0.1.0:

* Initial release
