0.1.1:

* Eliminate Actor.start: now there's a current Actor by default in every thread.
  This paves the way towards thread safety.

* Rename Revactor::Server to Revactor::Delegator and make more like delegator.rb

* Factor apart actor.rb into scheduler.rb and mailbox.rb

* Provide Revactor modules classes within the Actor namespace unless they have
  already been defined

* Fix Revactor::Filter initialization bug

* Include Revactor::VERSION variable

* Mailbox filters can now include only a timeout (i.e. sleep)

0.1.0:

* Initial release
