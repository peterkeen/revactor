# Actors are lightweight concurrency primitives which communiucate via message
# passing.  Each actor has a mailbox which it scans for matching messages.
# An actor sleeps until it receives a message, at which time it scans messages
# against its filter set and then executes appropriate callbacks.
#
# The Actor class is definined in the global scope in hopes of being generally
# useful for Ruby 1.9 users while also attempting to be as compatible as
# possible with the Rubinius Actor implementation.  In this way it should
# be possible to run programs written using Rev on top of Rubinius and hopefully
# get some better performance.
#
# Rev Actor implements some features that Rubinius does not, however, such as
# receive timeouts, receive filter-by-proc, arguments passed to spawn, and an
# actor dictionary (used for networking functionality).  Hopefully these 
# additional features will not get in the way of Rubinius / Rev compatibility.
